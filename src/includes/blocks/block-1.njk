        Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile IV.  Phrack Pro-Phile is created to bring info to
        you, the users, about old or highly important/controversial people.  This
        month, I bring to you one of the most influential users of our times and of
        days of old...

        Scan Man started out in the BBS world about 7 years ago when he first got his
        modem, a 300 Baud Auto-Answer/Auto-Dial Micro-Connection Modem (made by Micro
        Peripheral Corp.) with tape input and output.  Pirate 80 went up 4 years ago
        this Halloween, which consisted of a TRS Model 1, 3 40 track, single sided,
        double density floppies, and a 300 baud modem (which held up until 6 months
        ago).

        At the time of arising, the board was put up for interests in phreaking,
        hacking, as well as pirating.  Within the first 6 months to now, Scan Man had
        gone through 6 BBS programs, and is quite satisfied with the current one.

        First, he started with a pirated version of TBBS 1.2, then an upgrade to 1.3,
        pirated again (occurred and at the same time a hard drive was added after a
        number of disk drive changes and modifications).  Scan Man, through his BBS
        (which was in the first 5 all phreak/hack BBS's to ever go up, and is the
        oldest phreak board in the country), has met or talked to what he considers
        "anybody who is anybody".

        At 11 years old, he found a few old phones, took them apart, and got them
        working, which was when his interest in telecom arose.  He was led into the
        phreak world when he became aware that he could phreak (articles he read such
        as blue box articles).  At the time, BBS's and personal computers did not exist
        at this time.

        The first board he called that involved phreaking was the old Pirate's Harbor.
        An anonymous message posted there had a few alternate long distance service
        codes posted.  He was very excited that he had stumbled upon this thrill and he
        spent the first year or so calling around finding exactly what everyone was
        into and from there forward he started manufacturing various devices with The
        Researcher.  They worked together and learned together.

        Because so much information posted was inaccurate, they did this to make it
        accurate and found out what was the real stories.  The more memorable phreak
        boards that he was on included Plovernet, (and all pre-Plovernet), L.O.D., AT&amp;T
        Phone Center, Pirates of Puget Sound, as well as a few others which he couldn't
        remember offhand because it was so long ago.

        Scan Man's works as a computer consultant (systems analyst).  He checks
        security as well as enhancements, improvements, and debugging.  He's been doing
        this for about a year now.
